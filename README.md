First project for Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree:
https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-nd004/l-3561209451/m-3605748695

From the project assignment instructions, the goal was to:
- Install Python
- Create a data structure (i.e. a Python Class) to store your favorite movies, including movie title, box art URL (or poster URL) and a YouTube link to the movie trailer. 
- Create multiple instances of that Python Class to represent your favorite movies; group all the instances together in a list.
- To help you generate a website that displays these movies, we have provided a Python module called fresh_tomatoes.py.  This module has a function called open_movies_page that takes in one argument, which is a list of movies and creates an HTML file which visualizes all of your favorite movies.
- Ensure your website renders correctly when you attempt to load it in a browser.

This project consists of the following (slightly) original files:
- media.py : implements the Movie class for item 2 above.
- entertainment_center.py : 
      builds the list of movies for item 3 and
      invokes fresh_tomatoes (item 4) to display the website.

Assuming you have Python installed (I have version 3.5 on an iMac) you can download
this project from https://github.com/rastaehli/movieTrailers and run the main program 
entertainment_center.py with the Python IDE called "IDLE".
